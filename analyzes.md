#1 Square Root of an Integer
Line 2 (if number == 0 or number == 1:):
Performs a constant number of comparisons (==) to check if number is equal to 0 or 1. Therefore, its space complexity is O(1).

Line 3 (return number):
Returns the input number. No additional memory allocation is performed. Hence, its space complexity is O(1).

Lines 5-7 (start = 1, end = number, result = 0):
Assigns constant values to variables start, end, and result. These assignments require constant space. Therefore, their space complexity is O(1).

Lines 9-20 (While Loop):
The loop itself does not allocate any extra memory. It operates on existing variables (start, end, mid, and result). Therefore, its space complexity is O(1).

Lines 10-19 (Within While Loop):
Each operation inside the loop involves only arithmetic operations (+, -, //), comparisons (==, <), and variable assignments, all of which require constant space. Hence, the space complexity of these lines is O(1) collectively.

Line 22 (return result):
Returns the value stored in the variable result. Since result is just a single variable and its value is returned directly, the space complexity of this line is O(1).

Overall, the function's space complexity is dominated by the variables and operations that require constant space. Therefore, the space complexity of the entire function is O(1), indicating constant space usage regardless of the input size.

#2 Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
Line 2 (left, right = 0, len(input_list) - 1):
This line initializes two pointers, left and right, which requires constant time. Therefore, its time complexity is O(1).

Line 4 (while left <= right:):
The while loop iterates until the left pointer exceeds the right pointer, which takes O(log n) iterations in the worst case, where n is the size of the input list.

Line 5 (mid = (left + right) // 2):
This line calculates the midpoint index mid of the current search interval in constant time. Therefore, its time complexity is O(1).

Lines 8-18 (Within While Loop):
The operations within the while loop involve simple comparisons, assignments, and arithmetic operations, all of which require constant time. Therefore, the time complexity of these lines is O(1) collectively.

Line 20 (return -1):
This line simply returns -1 and takes constant time. Therefore, its time complexity is O(1).

Overall, the time complexity of the rotated_array_search function is dominated by the while loop, which has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the input list. The rest of the operations inside the loop have a constant time complexity of O(1).

#3 Rearrange Array Digits
Find Maximum and Minimum Elements (Lines 6-14):
- We iterate through the input list once to find the maximum and minimum elements. This operation has a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.

Count Digit Frequencies (Lines 18-20):
- We iterate through the input list again to count the frequency of each digit. This operation also has a linear time complexity of O(n).

Construct Numbers (Lines 23-35):

We iterate through the frequency array, which has a constant size of 10 (since there are only 10 digits). This operation has a constant time complexity of O(1).
Overall, the time complexity of the rearrange_digits_max_sum function is dominated by the linear scans of the input list to find the maximum and minimum elements and count digit frequencies. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.

In summary, the function has a linear time complexity, making it efficient for large input lists while meeting the requirement of O(n log n) time complexity stated in the problem.

#4 Dutch National Flag Problem
Initialization (Line 3):
- We initialize three pointers low, mid, and high. This operation takes constant time, O(1).

Traverse the Array (Lines 5-11):
- We traverse the array once using the mid pointer until it meets the high pointer.
- Inside the loop, we perform constant-time operations such as comparisons and swapping elements.
- As the array is traversed only once, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

Return (Line 13):
- After the traversal, we return the sorted array. This operation takes constant time, O(1).

Overall, the time complexity of the `sort_array` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

#5 Autocomplete with Tries
`TrieNode.insert(self, char)`:
This method inserts a character into the trie. It involves accessing and updating the children dictionary, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for both insertion and retrieval.
Therefore, the time complexity of this method is O(1).

`TrieNode.suffixes(self, suffix='')`:
This method finds all suffixes of words in the trie starting from the current node.
It recursively traverses the trie, appending characters to the suffix parameter and collecting suffixes at word-ending nodes.
The worst-case time complexity of this method depends on the size of the trie and the number of suffixes it contains. In the worst case, if there are n words in the trie and each word has a length of m, the time complexity can be O(n * m) due to the recursive traversal.
However, if the trie is balanced and contains a large number of words with similar prefixes, the time complexity can be better than O(n * m).

`Trie.insert(self, word)`:
This method inserts a word into the trie character by character. It iterates through the characters of the word and calls the insert method of TrieNode.
The time complexity of inserting a word of length m into the trie is O(m), where m is the length of the word.

`Trie.find(self, prefix)`:

This method searches for a prefix in the trie by iterating through its characters. It calls the insert method of TrieNode to traverse the trie.
The time complexity of searching for a prefix of length m in the trie is O(m), where m is the length of the prefix.

In summary, the time complexity of operations on the trie depends on the number of nodes and the structure of the trie. In general, trie operations have a time complexity of O(m), where m is the length of the word or prefix being operated on.

#6 Unsorted Integer Array
The function initializes min_val and max_value with the first element of the input array. This operation runs in constant time, O(1).

Traversal: The function iterates through the input array once, starting from the second element. This traversal has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

Comparison and Updates: For each element in the array (except the first one), the function performs two comparisons and, if necessary, updates both min_val and max_val. These comparisons and updates are constant time operations and occur for each element in the array, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n).

Return: After the traversal, the function returns a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values. This operation runs in constant time, O(1).

Overall, the time complexity of the `get_min_max_value` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the function iterates through the array once and performs constant time operations for each element. Thus, the function meets the requirement of running in O(n) time.

Now let's analyze the time complexity of the methods in these classes:

RouteTrie:

- `update`: This method inserts a path and its corresponding handler into the Trie. It iterates over each part of the path, accessing or creating nodes in the Trie. The time complexity is O(k), where k is the length of the path.
- `find_path`: This method finds the handler associated with a given path in the Trie. It iterates over each part of the path, accessing nodes in the Trie. The time complexity is O(k), where k is the length of the path.

Router:
- __init__: This method initializes a Router object by creating a RouteTrie instance. It has a time complexity of O(1).
- `add_handler`: This method adds a handler for a specific path in the router. It calls the update method of the Route class. The time complexity is O(k), where k is the length of the path.
- `looking`: This method looks up the handler for a given path in the router. It calls the find method of the Route class. The time complexity is O(k), where k is the length of the path.
- `split_path_parts`: This method splits a path into its individual parts. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the path.

Overall, the time complexity of inserting a path or finding a handler in the router is O(k), where k is the length of the path. The initialization of the router and Trie has a time complexity of O(1).
